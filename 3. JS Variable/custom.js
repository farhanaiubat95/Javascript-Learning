// Using let
// Using const

// The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
// The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.
// JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
// It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

"use strict";

let strings = "Hi, I am learning JS in 2024";
alert(strings);

// Const value only one time assign and never be changed
const pi = 3.1416; 
// pi = pi + 20; it's not working
alert(pi);
