    <p>
        1.The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. <br>
        2.The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers. <br>
        3.JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive. <br>
        4.It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
        5.Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.
        {
        var x = 2;
        }
